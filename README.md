# Solo_Project_Book_Thoughts

This is my final project I did for my full stack developer certification.

Book Thoughts was created with full stack JavaScript using MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

The website has full CRUD operations and allows users to add their book review (aka Book Thoughts) to the database that displays on the main page.

I plan to add additional features in the future, such as login and registration as well as other interactions between users.
